## Business Problem:

To Predicting the survival of the passengers on Titanic (Titanic Disaster Dataset).

## Methodology:

1. Importing Data - Utilizing NumPy and Pandas.
2. Data Visualisation - Used Box Plot, Count Plot, Histogram, HeatMap, etc to represent the data.
3. Machine Learning Modeling - Supervised Machine learning techniques: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, K-nearest neighbours, Neural Network.

### Data Analysis:

Used the NLP to predict the personalised movie recommendation.

## Skills:

    Python3
    Numpy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Machine Learning Algorithm
    Classification Algorithms
    Random Forest

## Result and Business Recommendation:

Used supervised machine learning techniques: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, K-nearest neighbours, Neural Network.

Out of which only 3 models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) out of 6 models provide 100% accuracy (i.e. 1.0)

So, I used the Random Forest Classifier to predict all the survivors correctly.

## Next Steps:

1. Making a Webpage to implement this model.
2. Making same model using Azure.
